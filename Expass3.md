### Technical problems that encountered during installation and how they were resolved
I did not experience any particular technical issues during the installation process.

### Any pending issues with this assignment that I did not manage to solve
I can make users, polls, and options for the poll, but the voting function is not working. It seems that the program is unable to fetch from votes, but when I test votes in Postman, it works. I haven't had time to look into this further.
I wanted to implement that a user can vote for an option and that a vote count is recorded for that option. I have not managed to solve this yet.
To display the question created in the dropdown menu, the page needs to be refreshed. This is also an issue Iâ€™m not quite sure how to solve. 
If I have had time, I also would have wanted to try to implement a login. But that is something I can work on later.
