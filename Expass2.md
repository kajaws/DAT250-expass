### Technical problems that encountered during installation and how they were resolved
I did not experience any particular technical issues during the installation process. 

### Any pending issues with this assignment that I did not manage to solve
I wasn't able to complete all the tests. Most of the tests run successfully in the 'PollAppIntegrationTest.java' file, and I've also created an HTTP file where I believe most of the test cases are correct. 
While working on the task, I used Postman to check if the code was functioning as expected. I had never used this tool before, but I found it very useful. 

Moving forward, I plan to ensure the HTTP file is correct, get all the tests to pass, and further modify the code for better functionality. 
For example, I need to keep track of the vote count for each option, and when a new user votes for the same option as another user, the votes should be recorded without overwriting each other.
I also need to add a GitHub action to the repository to run the tests automatically.
