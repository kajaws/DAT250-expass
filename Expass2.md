### Technical problems that encountered during installation and how they were resolved
I did not experience any particular technical issues during the installation process. 

### Any pending issues with this assignment that I did not manage to solve
I think it was difficult to understand how to implement the java test at first, and not sure if I have done it in the correct way, but the test passes. 
While working on this assignment, I used Postman to check if the code was functioning as expected. I had never used this tool before, but I found it very useful.

Moving forward, I plan to modify the code further for better functionality. 
For example, I need to keep track of the vote count for each option, and when a new user votes for the same option as another user, the votes should be recorded without overwriting each other.
